# About Quark

Quark is an integrated development environment for rapidly building functional , prototypal projects that run as a desktop application inside of an electronjs/nodejs process. 

Quark IDE is basically three distinct components:

1. __A Code Editor__ - This is the place where you write your code.
2. __A Build System__ - This is the place that builds and bundles all your code into a single build file _(*.build.qrk)_ that can be run withing the Quark runtime environment.
3. __Runtime Environment__ - This is an Electron renderer process which executes the build file emitted by the build system. Within the runtime environment, you have access to the Quark API.

# User Interface
At the heart of Quark IDE is a code editor. Like many other code editors, Quark adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left showing all of the files and folders in your project, an editor on the right showing contents of the file you've opened.

## Basic Layout 
Quark IDE comes with a simple and intuitive layout that maximizes the space provided for the editor while leaving ample room to browse and access the full context of your folder or project. The UI is divided into five areas:

  * __Editor__ - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
  * __Side Bar__ - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
  * __Status Bar__ - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
  * __Activity Bar__ - Located on the far left-hand side, this lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled.
  * __Panels__ - You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated terminal. Panel can also be moved to the right for more vertical space.

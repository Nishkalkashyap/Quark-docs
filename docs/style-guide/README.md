# Style Guide

This is the official style guide for Quark-specific code. This is a great reference to avoid errors, bikeshedding, and anti-patterns for projects made with Quark. However, we don’t believe that any style guide is ideal for all teams or projects, so mindful deviations are encouraged based on past experience and the surrounding tech stack.

For the most part, we also avoid suggestions about JavaScript or HTML in general. We don’t mind whether you use semicolons or trailing commas. We don’t mind whether your HTML uses single-quotes or double-quotes for attribute values. Some exceptions will exist however, where we’ve found that a particular pattern is helpful in the context of Quark.
